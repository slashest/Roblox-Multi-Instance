# Roblox-Multi-Instance
Simple program to allow multiple Roblox instances to be run

#Usage
Run main.py before launching any roblox instances and aslong as it runs without any errors. You can launch as many Roblox instances as your PC can handle. This was created as an alternative to Bloxstrap's multi-instance since pizzaboxer recently removed the feature.
